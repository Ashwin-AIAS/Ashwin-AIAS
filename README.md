## 🧩 Features

### 🎮 GitHub Contribution Pinball Game

A playful interactive animation inspired by your contribution graph — just like in the video demo!  
The ball bounces through your contributions, creating a dynamic “pinball” effect synced with your GitHub activity.

- Animated pinball game runs automatically on page load.  
- Real-time contribution visualization using SVG + JS.  
- Fully responsive for both light and dark GitHub themes.  
- Makes your profile visually engaging and unique.

</p>

> *(If the animation doesn't appear, check that your GitHub Actions or `output` branch is public.)*

### 📊 GitHub Activity Insights

A live summary of your coding stats and contributions.

- Tracks commits, pull requests, and code reviews.  
- Displays total yearly contributions and activity streak.  
- Highlights your most active repositories.  
- Helps recruiters visualize your consistency.

*Sample: yearly contributions & repo summary.*

### 🖼️ How to View Demos
All demo assets (GIFs or screenshots) should be placed in the `images/` folder.  
To preview the **pinball animation**, ensure your GitHub repository has a public `output/` branch that hosts the generated SVG.  
You can create it via [Platane’s GitHub Snake Game](https://github.com/Platane/snk) and customize it into the **pinball variant**.
